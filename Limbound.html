        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            Limbound is a very simple 2d platformer made in unity where the player needs to use light to see where they have to go.
            Limbound was made as a school assignment where the goal was to create a simple 2d platformer with a unique point to it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I chose to use the lighing feature because i wanted to try using the URP lighting engine instead of the base one that unity has.
          The lighting feature also makes for a fun and frustrating game where you need to keep finding out where to go.
